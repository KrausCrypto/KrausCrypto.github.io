                    <figcaption>One of my favorite foods in the world is Salmon. It tastes so good especially with Miso. I have cooked this dish for a few years now and usually serve it with brocolli and rice as I feel that it pairs well.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>Chicken Parm is hands down my favorite food of all time. I eat it maybe 2 times per week religiously. I love making it my self with fresh mozzarella and unseasoned breadcrumbs. I then like to make a homemade tomato sauce to put over the chicken. When put into a sandwhich, the flavors are amplified and you also get the added texture of the bread. It is so good! </figcaption>
