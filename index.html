            <figcaption>This is a picture of me. I am currently a Senior at the University of Wisconsin studying communcation arts. I am hoping to learn more about making websites so in the future I can launch some really cool webapps. I enjoy many things in life but two 
                of the most enjoyable things for me to do is watch movies and eat good food. On this website, I will be sharing some of my favorite movies and foods I have enjoyed throughout
                my lifetime.
